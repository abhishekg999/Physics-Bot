Assume the field in Neyland Stadium runs perfectly north and south.  Beginning with an initial position of 60.0 yds. , 90.0° from the south goal post, Mr. M marches (in linear segments) the following four displacements in succession:  d1 = 10.0 yds, 0.0°,
d2 = 11.2 yds, 206.6°,
d3 = 11.2 yds, 333.4°,
d4 = 10.0 yds, 180.0°.  
From initial to final position what is the total distance?

In the 1940’s rocket-powered sleds were used to test the responses of humans to acceleration.  Suppose the sled reaches a speed of 222 m/s in 2.10 s and then in another 0.90 s is brought to a stop.  Determine the greatest number of g's (in any direction) experienced by the rider.  (Use g equal to 9.80 m/s2.)

A 2010 Chevy Camaro went from zero to 20 mph, 40 mph, and 60 mph, in times of 1.1 s, 2.6 s, and 4.6 s respectively.  This is an interesting pattern because the average acceleration changes by about the same percentage for every 20 mph faster the car goes.
By about what percent does the acceleration rate change per every 20 mph increase?
